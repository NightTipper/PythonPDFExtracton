# PythonPDFExtracton
Script built to extract specific data from a PDF.

Languages used: Python
Modules used: PdfReader, PDFquery, and sys

# Reason for script:

The script was designed to be used in conjunction with other similar scripts. The idea is to get all the desired information from a PDF. This particular script was focused on the 'Account Number' from the PDF. 

Extraction of the PDF was then used to update a SharePoint column for archived finance purposes. As the file would then be hosted on SharePoint, this allowed the finance department to be able to search through the SharePoint metadata and locate past invoices if necessary.
